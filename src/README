No shared memory?!?!?!

But I guess we're supposed to learn bad practices by doing them.
    So the threads will alternate outputting their fibonacci number.
    As in, they will calculate each of them, but suppress every other.

So everything here's pretty straightforward.  The waits are a bit wonky,
    but the actual outputs and order of execution is solid.

Things I learned:
	Perror literally everything.  Seriously helped in debugging.
	pointers are incredibly confusing
	Documentation on anything is hit or miss if it works on your OS
	The keywords change, and things will be deprecated
	inline definitions don't play nicely with pointers,
	    e.g. int outcome = waitpid(pid, &outcome, 0);
