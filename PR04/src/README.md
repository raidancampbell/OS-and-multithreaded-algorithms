fun times* with RPC's

So I pretty much understand RPC's.
I mean, they're simple: you call it like it's there, and RPCGEN handles it
you gotta take care of both sides of the equation, but in the end it just works

But yeah, this whole "mailbox" thing doesn't really work.
I'm going for partial credit.  I tried, honestly.  but I couldn't do it.
There's code there that makes sense to me, but SEGFAULT says no.
well, sorry for this, but best of luck with grading.
