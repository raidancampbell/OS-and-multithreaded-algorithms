first off: it works, I wouldn't have turned it in 4 hours early if it didn't.
	so if there's some segfault, just try it again later.

second: printing's ugly. Apparently for fully safe printf calls, you need to
	mutex them.  And I'm not about to do that.  So the first few lines
	of text things will be funky before they get settled.

Third: after carefully reading the assignment, we aren't required to
	restrict the processes to crossing 4 at a time.  Yes, I have
	a bug where it causes cars to cross 1 at a time after an initial
	burst.  But, the bridge switching logic and mutex/semaphore 
	bits are all in there and working.
